# MachineLearningPractice_MusicGenrePrediction
Predicts a person's favorite music genre using gender and age

This repository is based on a tutorial given by Mosh Hamedani to practice the basics of machine learning. 
By using the decision tree classifier algorithm from the scikit-learn library and basic methods from the pandas library, we can create a **very simple** prediction of a person's favorite music genre based on their gender and age.
